# nesC_tcpserver
A tcp server and client written in nesC for UC Merced's CSE 160 class.
Much of the code comes from the skeleton code. This mostly consists of setting up the environment and basic variables.
The skeleton code can be found here: https://github.com/UCMAndesLab/CSE160-Project-Skeleton-Code

This code implements the 4 CSE 160 projects. These include neighbor discovery, flooding, routing based on dijkstra's algorithm, TCP, and a chatroom server and client.
